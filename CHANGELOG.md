## [Unreleased]

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- Align all agent, skill, instruction, and prompt guidance with `@tsfpp/prelude` 2.0.0 and `@tsfpp/boundary` 2.0.0. Updated API names: Option combinators `mapO`→`mapOption`, `flatMapO`→`flatMapOption`, `orElse`→`orElseOption`, `getOrElse`→`getOrElseOption`, `traverseArrayO`→`traverseArrayOption`, `sequenceArrayO`→`sequenceArrayOption`; `entriesOfMap`→`entriesOf`; boundary `createHandler`/`createJsonHandler`/`createNodeAdapter`→`mk*`. Bumped peer ranges to `@tsfpp/prelude >=2.0.0`, `@tsfpp/boundary >=2.0.0`, `@tsfpp/standard >=1.3.0`.

### Features

- Cover the standard's new rules across the coding-standard skill and base instructions: 1.13 (numeric hazards / branded numerics), 1.14 (`satisfies` over `as`), 4.6 (no ambient nondeterminism — inject via `Deps`), 6.7 (`kind`-tagged error unions), 7.8 (ADT-combinator suffix convention — `Result` base), 8.5 (total `match` eliminators).
- Document the Rule 7.8 naming convention in the prelude skill and instructions; add the new prelude 2.0.0 exports (`match`, `mapErr`, `findO`, `headNonEmpty`/`lastNonEmpty`, `mkInt`/`mkPositive`/`mkNonNegative`, `isFiniteNumber`).

### Fixed

- Corrected Ramda framing (removed in standard v1.1.0; not a dependency) and clarified that Remeda is a *recommended, optional* collection library, not a dependency.
- Normalized all TSF++ spec references to `node_modules/@tsfpp/standard/spec/CODING_STANDARD.md`.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-28

### Features

- `feat(build): compile Copilot, workflow, and Claude assets from ai sources` — Build output now compiles Copilot instructions and GitHub workflows from canonical `ai/` sources, with Claude context sourced from `ai/claude/tsfpp.md` and deployed to `.claude/tsfpp.md`.
- `feat(agents): add MCP-driven guidance across agents, instructions, and skills` — Added always-on MCP instruction routing and integrated tool-first flows (`get_rule`, `get_layer`, `get_pattern`, `get_deviation`, `check_pattern`, `get_api_surface`) in TSF++ agents and skill guidance.

### Chores

- `chore(repo): stop tracking generated compatibility outputs` — Removed tracked generated `.ai/` and `.github/` compatibility assets from this package repository, keeping only source files and runtime workflow output policy.
- `chore(package): add optional @tsfpp/mcp-server peer dependency` — MCP server is now declared as an optional peer to signal enhanced integration without making installation a hard requirement.

### Documentation

- Updated README to document canonical `ai/` source locations, generated client outputs, and repository tracking policy for generated compatibility files.
- Clarified README MCP behavior as progressive enhancement: package remains usable without MCP, while connected mode provides authoritative tooling.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-25

### Features

- `feat(agents): compile ai sources into .ai during init` — Bootstrapped projects now use `.ai/` as the editable AI source tree while `.github/` remains a generated compatibility layer.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-05-20

### Documentation

- `docs(boundary-api): update skill guide and instructions for v1.2.0 handler APIs` — Boundary API guidance now reflects the v1.2.0 handler-helper flow, including config loading and Node adapter usage.
- `docs(prelude): refine instructions and update logger port types` — Prelude guidance now uses cleaner import patterns and streamlined Option/Result examples for day-to-day implementation.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-05-20

### Chores

- `chore(agents): enforce AAA formatting and improve escalation policy` — Test-writing agents now mandate blank lines between Arrange/Act/Assert phases; guarded-coding agent applies known violations immediately instead of requesting permission.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-05-19

### Features

- `feat(agents): improve init and bootstrap release workflow` - Installer setup now merges Copilot instructions safely, initializes release manifest metadata, and includes bootstrap scripts in package outputs.
- `feat(agents): add debugging and trunk commit agents` - Added `tsfpp-debug` and `trunk-commit` agent definitions for Copilot workflows.
- `feat(init): deploy additional trunk and debug agents` - `init.mjs` now installs `tsfpp-debug`, `trunk-commit`, `trunk-enforcer`, and `trunk-release` into `.github/agents`.
- `feat(agents): improve trunk commit automation flow` - Renamed the Copilot agent to `tsfpp-trunk-commit`, added push/PR automation guidance, and made validation script checks conditional on configured package scripts.
- `feat(agents): improve GitHub trunk commit automation flow` - Updated the `.github` trunk commit agent with `tsfpp-trunk-commit` naming, push/PR automation steps, and script-aware pre-commit validation checks.
- `feat(bootstrap): scaffold README and changelog in generated projects` - Bootstrapped projects now include ready-to-use documentation files and clearer package metadata defaults.

### Bug fixes

- `fix(bootstrap): run setup non-interactively` - Bootstrap now suppresses `pnpm init` noise and uses `init.mjs --yes` so setup can complete unattended.
- `fix(agents): restore trunk-commit agent name` - Copilot users can invoke the trunk commit workflow using the expected `trunk-commit` agent name.

### Documentation

- Updated `README.md` agent and installation inventory to include the new debugging and trunk commit agents.
- Added explicit Option and Result assertion guidance to `tsfpp-tdd`, `tsfpp-backfill-tests`, and the test standard skill.

- Added `copilot/agents/tsfpp-tdd.agent.md` for dedicated test-first workflow that writes failing, proper tests before implementation starts.

### Changed

- Updated `copilot/agents/tsfpp-guarded-coding.agent.md` to include multi-layer request focus.
- Updated `copilot/agents/tsfpp-guarded-coding.agent.md` to enforce a prelude-first rule before execution workflow as a hard reflex, not an afterthought.
- Updated `copilot/agents/tsfpp-audit.agent.md` so focus `api` applies both API_CODE_STANDARD rules and prefers `boundary` idioms over hand-rolled repeats.
- Updated `copilot/agents/tsfpp-audit.agent.md` to strengthen checks for Prelude anti-patterns.
- Updated `copilot/agents/tsfpp-audit.agent.md` to support focus `test`.
- Updated `copilot/agents/tsfpp-guarded-coding.agent.md` to hand off to `tsfpp-tdd` before starting implementation.
- Expanded `copilot/instructions/tsfpp-base.instructions.md`: replaced `brand()` with the correct smart-constructor `as` idiom, added a discriminant-convention table, and added `new Map()`/`new Set()`/`try-catch`/`null` checks to the Never list.
- Expanded `copilot/instructions/tsfpp-prelude.instructions.md`: added `ReadonlyMap`/`ReadonlySet`, unknown record decoding helpers (`isRecord`, `getStringField`, etc.), `fromUnknownArrayOf`, `sequenceArrayO`, `isCons`/`isNil`, and `UnknownRecord`; removed `brand()` and removed `mapErr` (not in `fp-ts`); added a `pipe` vs `flow` section.
- Expanded `copilot/instructions/tsfpp-api.instructions.md`: fixed the `fromZodError` + `fold` error path to `apiErrorToResponse(fromZodError(e), ctx)`, completed the import list, added middleware composition via `pipe`, and documented pagination, rate limiting, CORS, bulk operations, LROs, and `cause` warnings for internal/dependency errors.
- Expanded `copilot/instructions/tsfpp-react.instructions.md`: corrected memoization guidance (no speculative memoization), added a state-elimination ladder, expanded effect discipline with explicit do/don't examples, and added guidance for TanStack Query key factories, RHF + Zod, typed router usage, narrow Zustand selectors, `cva`/`cn` styling, plus a complete Forbidden list.

### Fixed

- Fixed `copilot/copilot-instructions.md` after an earlier overwrite that incorrectly replaced it with API-only instructions.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Added `react` and `data` as supported focus values for `copilot/agents/tsfpp-audit.agent.md`.
- Added Data profile overlay support via `node_modules/@tsfpp/standard/spec/DATA_CODING_STANDARD.md`.

- Updated TSF++ standard reference paths in `copilot/agents/tsfpp-audit.agent.md` to `node_modules/@tsfpp/standard/spec/*.md`.
- Updated audit startup prompt and argument hints to include React and Data focused targets.

### Removed

- Removed checklist rule `8.x` (prelude ADT/helper reuse enforcement) from the base audit template.
- Simplified checklist rule `9.x` from broad dependency hygiene checks to a direct `ramda` import guard.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- Updated `init.mjs` questionnaire flow to avoid overwriting existing `tsconfig` and ESLint config files.
- Added `N`/skip escape hatch for existing-file prompts.
- Added `SIGINT` handling by wrapping execution in `main` so Ctrl+C exits cleanly without hanging awaits.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-16
